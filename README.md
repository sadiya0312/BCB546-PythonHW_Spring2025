## This repository is the anlaysis of mitrochondrial cytochrome-b DNA of penguin. There is one python file that performs all the analysis and others are input data files.
#### The analysis include exploration of data and calculation of molecular weight and GC content. These factors are further visualized through histogram and heat map and then analysed using Kmeans cluster and PCA plot to understand evolutionary closeness among penguine. The purpose of this project is to understand the implementatio of different python libraries on biological data. This project can further can be enhanced with some concrete results if provided with enough data.
##### To Run: You need to install jupyter notebook and libraries given in first section of code. Once you download all the project in a single folder, you should be easily able to run each section of the python code without any trouble.
##### Please feel free to reach out to the owner of this account if you encounter any trouble executing the code.
